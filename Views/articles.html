            <h1>What Are Articles in English Grammar?</h1><br><br>

            <p>
                Articles are words that are used before nouns to indicate whether the nouns refer to specific or nonspecific items, objects, or concepts. In English, there are two types of articles: definite articles and indefinite articles.

        <h1>Types of Articles:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Definite Article</li>
            <li>Indefinite Article</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Definite Articles:</h3>
        <p>The definite article in English is "the." It is used before singular or plural nouns to refer to specific items that are already known to the speaker and the listener or are defined within the context of the conversation. </p>
        <p>For example</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The cat is on the roof
            </li>
            <li>
                I saw the movie you recommended.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Indefinite articles:</h3>
        <p>The indefinite articles in English are "a" and "an." They are used before singular nouns to refer to nonspecific or unspecified items, objects, or concepts. "A" is used before words that begin with a consonant sound, while "an" is used before words that begin with a vowel sound. </p>
        <p>For example</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                I saw a cat in the garden.
            </li>
            <li>
                She wants to buy an apple.
            </li>
        </ol>
