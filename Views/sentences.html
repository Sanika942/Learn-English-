        <strong><center>Sentences</center></strong>
        <p>A sentence is a group of words which, when they are written down, begin with a capital letter and end with a full stop, question mark, or exclamation mark.</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The dog is bigger than the cat.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

                <h1 >Declarative sentences</h1>
                <p>Declarative sentences are a good place to start because they’re the standard. Essentially, a declarative sentence is a simple statement used to communicate a fact, an opinion, an observation, or an explanation.</p>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>The sun rises in the east.</p><br>
                <p>Note:Declarative sentences always end in a period.</p>

                <h1>Interrogative sentences</h1>
                <p>Questions are known formally as interrogative sentences. These sentences request more information in the form of answers, usually to confirm something or fill in missing information. Interrogative sentences can be tricky because they sometimes require putting the verb before the subject or using an auxiliary verb like do.</p>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>Where is the nearest post office?</p>
                <p>Note:Interrogative sentences end with a question mark.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-5" style="background-color: green">
                <h1>Imperative sentences</h1>
                <p>Imperative sentences are commands, instructions, or advice you give to others to tell them what to do. In imperative sentences, the subject is often assumed. It’s usually obvious that the subject is whomever the sentence is directed at, so the subject can be dropped and the reader can assume the missing subject is you.</p>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>Please close the door.</p>
                <p>Note:Imperative sentences usually end in a period, but they can also use an exclamation point if they’re emphatic</p>

                <h1>Exclamatory sentences</h1>
                <p>Usually, exclamatory sentences behave just like declarative sentences, except with more emotion or urgency.</p>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>What a beautiful sunset!</p>
                <p>Note:Exclamatory sentences also include interjections like “Ouch!” or “Yippee!” to convey sudden emotion.</p>
